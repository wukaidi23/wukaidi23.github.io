      <h2>The Effect of SNAP Disbursement Disruptions on Grocery Purchases</h2>  
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: Many researchers find that SNAP participants do not spend their monthly benefits smoothly, resulting in costs 
    to both recipients and retailers. While many states adopted a staggered distribution of benefits to reduce the burden on retailers,
    no measures exist to increase the frequency of benefit payment. The 2019 government shutdown provides the unique opportunity to 
    investigate because February benefits were issued early, and states elected to split payments for March benefits in 2019. In this 
    paper, I examine the SNAP spending cycle during the disruption using detailed grocery purchase data from the Nielsen Homescan Panel. 
    In the first week following the early payment, daily expenditures on SNAP-eligible items are 10% higher than in subsequent weeks. 
    The increase is significant for fresh produce, frozen foods, dairy products, and meat. In this benefit cycle, spending is steeper 
    than when disbursements are staggered, suggesting staggering payment smooths aggregate spending. Investigation of the twice-monthly 
    disbursement shows evidence of the smoothing effect of higher payment frequency at the individual level. These findings agree with 
    predictions from the neoclassical consumption-saving model under hyperbolic discounting. Therefore, the timing of the SNAP payment 
    affects households' food purchasing behavior and changing the frequency of SNAP payments may reduce the consumption decline that SNAP 
    households experience. </p> 
      
      <h2>The Effect of SNAP on Dietary Quality: Evidence from FoodAPS</h2>
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: As the largest food assistance program in the United States, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 
    aims to end hunger and improve nutrition and health among poor households. Although food expenditures have increased, evidence of 
    improvements in nutrition has been mixed. Based on the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey data, this paper examines the causal 
    effects of SNAP participation through various approaches that address self-selection into the program and misclassification of 
    participation status. The use of control strategies that rely on independence assumptions results in a negative effect of SNAP 
    participation on diet quality, even if participation increases food consumption. The results of partial identification fail to 
    identify a strict positive effect on diet quality when monotonicity assumptions are taken into account. </p> 
  
      <h2>A Sweet Burden? The Effect of The Bride Price on Parents’ Health [<i>with X. Li and Y. Ding</i>]</h2>   
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: The bride price, as an informal institution originated from traditional culture, is pervasive in many areas of the
  developing world in a form of payment from the family of the groom to that of the bride at marriage. We study
  the effects of bride price on parents’ health in China. Using information on bride price payment and various
  health measures from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), combined with a control
  function approach, we find that the bride price significantly reduces self-reported health among the grooms’
  parents. The deterioration in health is associated with declines in both physical and mental health. The reductions
  are most prominent among younger, less-educated, lower-income parents living in rural areas. Mechanism
  analysis suggests the negative health outcomes are driven by higher debts and lower fitness expenditures caused
  by bride price payments.</p>
