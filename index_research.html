          <h1>Working Papers</h1>
      <h2>The Effect of Disruptions in SNAP Disbursement on Grocery Purchases</h2>  
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, I test the hypothesis that the disruption in SNAP payment schedule caused a change in the purchasing 
  behavior among SNAP participating households. Using detailed grocery purchasing data from the Nielsen Homescan Panel, I estimate 
  difference-in-difference regressions that compare spending in the benefit cycle following the disruption caused by the federal 
  government shutdown to the spending during same calendar dates in the prior year where there were no disruptions in the SNAP 
  issuance schedule. I show that the early payment caused an increase in spending on SNAP eligible items in the first two weeks 
  followed by a drop in spending in the remaining weeks until the next payment. The spending pattern in this payment cycle is steeper 
  than if it were staggered disbursement in the normal times. The findings conform with the predictions from the neoclassical 
  consumption-saving model with present-biased preference. The results suggest SNAP payment schedule has a significant impact on 
  households’ purchasing behavior and changing the frequency of SNAP payment has the potential of smoothing the calorie crunch suffered 
  by SNAP participating households.</p> 
      
      <h2>The Effect of SNAP on Dietary Quality: Evidence from FoodAPS</h2>
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: With the goal of ending hunger and improving nutrition and health among poor households, the Supplemental 
  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest food assistance program in the United States. Despite the increase in 
  food expenditures, evidence on improvements in nutrition are mixed. This paper examines the causal effect of SNAP participation 
  through various approaches with the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey data addressing self-selection into the program and 
  misclassification of participation status. Using control strategies that depend on independence assumptions, I find a negative 
  effect of SNAP participation on diet quality even though participation increases food consumption. Under monotonicity assumptions, 
  partial identification fails to identify a strict positive effect on diet quality.</p> 
  
      <h2>A Sweet Burden? The Effect of The Bride Price on Parents’ Health [<i>with X. Li and Y. Ding</i>]</h2>   
  <p><b>Abstract</b>: The bride price, as an informal institution originated from traditional culture, is pervasive in many areas of the
  developing world in a form of payment from the family of the groom to that of the bride at marriage. We study
  the effects of bride price on parents’ health in China. Using information on bride price payment and various
  health measures from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), combined with a control
  function approach, we find that the bride price significantly reduces self-reported health among the grooms’
  parents. The deterioration in health is associated with declines in both physical and mental health. The reductions
  are most prominent among younger, less-educated, lower-income parents living in rural areas. Mechanism
  analysis suggests the negative health outcomes are driven by higher debts and lower fitness expenditures caused
  by bride price payments.</p>
